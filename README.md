## Assignment 2
Understanding file hierarchies and file permissions by writing scripts to create and mod file permissions. Writing basic scripts to create directories and mod file permissions.

## Assignemnt 3
Designing and implementing C++ programs to run pings on different hosts by using pipes shared between parent and child processes. As the ICMP packet is reccieved from the parent process, the rtt times are analyzed to determine statisitcs.


## Assignment 4
Engineering C++ programs to run pings on different hosts by using a parent process to create multiple threads to read ICMP packets. Upon the arrival of the results, rtt times are analyzed to determine statistics. Creating the same ping program with a client and server socket programs.
